notes = DANGER! DO NOT USE WITHOUT CHOSING FAST FILAMENT SETTINGS.\n\nThese settings WILL NOT WORK with small parts!\n\nPermits higher speed, at cost of reduced part quality. Using these speeds without higher extrusion temperatures WILL cause extruder skipping, and possibly worse.\n\nIntended exclusively for manufacturing very large parts, up to the machine print volume, which is not yet well tested.
